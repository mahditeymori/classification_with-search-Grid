### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I worked on the data from the Dry Bean Dataset and applied various machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to analyze the problem. I also attempted to remove features with high correlation to improve accuracy, but this did not lead to better results.
